## User Story
As a busy parent of three children with different medical needs, it can become increasingly difficult to stay on-top of things. Managing paperwork across emails, physical folders, and various portals is often overwhelming. 

Once I discovered Caremigo, I created individual profiles for each of my kids. I simply uploaded all the documents from recent appointments, and let the AI scan and explain them. It even highlighted sections with greater importance, and suggested local specialists in my area for follow-ups. All of the features culminated in a Kanban board, categorizing my next steps into different sections for better organization.

Thanks to Caremigo, I feel empowered to make informed decisions about my children's health and education, saving time and reducing stress.
