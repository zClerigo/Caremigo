## Description
One of our founders, Zidanni's, family has their own doctors in the Philippines. Specifically, his grandma has to approach multiple different doctors for blood tests, medical imaging, and many other health concerns. However, without a centralized online health portal in the country, she has to wait and go back to the office after days just to see her results. And when she gets her paper results, they are littered with esoteric terms and confusing numbers that are oftentimes diffucult for her to understand. And since Zidanni's grandma is old, his family has the choice to either do hours of personal research, or pay for a future appointment with the doctor in order to interpret these values, understand what they mean, and see what we can do for their grandma. And sometimes in less developed countries like the Philippines, they have to seek out the second or third opinion of multiple doctors instead of completely relying on oneâ€™s opinion.

Caremigo, our solution, is a web app that can analyze and provide a layman's interpretation of you and your loved ones medical documents, outline the steps you can take now to mitigate out-of-bound measurements, and recommend you to the best specialists in your area based on your values. We strive to demystify health results and eliminate the hours of personal research already done by concerned parents and children in regards to health documentation. Simply upload, scan, and get clear actionable insights on key terms, next steps, and local specialists within your area that can treat your specific issues. Organize documents easily with built-in task boards for quick access, helping you keep track of what matters most.
